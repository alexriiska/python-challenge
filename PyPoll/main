# You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
# Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
    # The total number of votes cast
    # A complete list of candidates who received votes
    # The percentage of votes each candidate won
    # The total number of votes each candidate won
    # The winner of the election based on popular vote

import os
import csv

#import the csv path

    #skip the header row
